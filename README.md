# Excel Project: Analyzing Sales Data from an Online Store

This represents my inaugural Excel project, wherein I have acquired a sample dataset from an online store. I meticulously processed, organized, and created an annual report from the dataset, employing a range of visual aids such as pivot tables, graphs, pie charts, and sliders.

The ensuing inquiries serve as an integral part of the project:

1)Employing a unified chart, conduct a comparative analysis of sales and orders.
2)Identify the month that exhibited the highest sales and orders. 
3)Determine whether men or women made more purchases in 2022.
4)Vvarious order statuses observed in the same year.
5)Compile a comprehensive list of the top 10 states that significantly contribute to the overall sales.
6)Undertake an exploration of the correlation between age and gender based on frequency of occurrences.
7)Ascertain the channel that contributes the most to overall sales.
8)Determine the category that boasts the highest sales figures.

I have successfully addressed the aforementioned queries and skillfully developed an interactive dashboard utilizing Microsoft Excel.

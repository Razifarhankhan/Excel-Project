# First-Excel-Project

This is my first Excel project in which I have taken a sample dataset from an online store, created an annual report, sorted it, and generated various visualizations such as pivot tables, graphs, pie charts, sliders, etc.

Sample questions:

1)Compare the sales and orders using a single chart. 
2)Which month had the highest sales and orders?
3)Who made more purchases - men or women in 2022? 
4)What are the different order statuses in 2022?
5)List the top 10 states contributing to the sales.
6)Explore the relationship between age and gender based on the number of occurrences.
7)Which channel is contributing to the maximum sales?
8)What is the highest selling category?, etc.

I have solved the above questions and created an interactive dashboard in Excel
